# Pygame Minesweeper Clone

A really barebones Minesweeper clone built with Pygame. I just wanted to implement the algorithm.

## Requirements

- [Python 3.13](https://www.python.org/)
- [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (fast Python package manager)

## How to run

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pygame-minesweeperclone.git
    cd pygame-minesweeperclone
    ```

2. **Run with UV:**
    ```bash
    uv run main.py
    ```


## Notes

- Make sure you have a working display for Pygame. (duh)
- For more info on UV, see [UV documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).
